Project Title: Basic Todo List with Status Filter
ðŸ§  Project Overview:
You will build a simple Todo List simulation using JavaScript only (no input, no browser UI). Each todo item will be represented as an object with two properties:

The task title (like "Do homework")


The completion status (true if done, false if still ongoing)


Your job is to organize all the todos into two separate categories:

Completed tasks


Ongoing tasks

ðŸŽ¯ Project Requirements:
Create an array of todo items


Each item must be an object with:


A title (string)


A done (true/false) status


Filter the todos


Separate the todos into two arrays:


One for tasks that are completed (done: true)


One for tasks that are still ongoing (done: false)


Display the tasks


Print all completed tasks under a "Done" section


Print all ongoing tasks under an "Ongoing" section
